      <div class="title_text">Description</div>
      <p class="text_regular">Staging environment of "My App" on a public cloud, integrated with cloud services</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <div class="title_text">Overview</div>
      <p class="text_regular">Our App is almost ready to be pushed to production and now is the time to make sure it works as expected in a staging environment. In this sandbox, we follow best practices for a production environment and use cloud services such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer and AWS CloudFront (CDN service). "My App" is deployed as a 2-tier application with multiple web servers for redundancy and a load balancer distributing the traffic between them.<br>
        <br> Note that this blueprint is an offline template of the sandbox. In real life scenarios, such a blueprint is usually created by DevOps engineers to be used by testers, developers or by some CI process. It is even possible to integrate with pipeline tools that will push this staging sandbox, once approved, to production. <br>
        <br> Sandbox components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>My App Web Server</strong>&nbsp;- the web server of the application "My App", installed on Linux Ubuntu</li>
        <li><strong>My SQL DB</strong>&nbsp;- the database of the application "My App", installed on Linux Ubuntu</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Elastic&nbsp;Load Balancer</strong> - a classic load balancer cloud service by AWS</li>
        <li><strong>AWS CloudFront</strong> - a global CDN cloud service by AWS, configured as the application front</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text_regular">Note that the component you see on the sandbox canvas are either "applications" (a.k.a "Apps") or "services". Those are terms used in CloudShell to describe the types of component within the sandbox, not to be confused with the "My App" sample application (which consists of multiple.App and service component in this sandbox).<br>
        <br> You might have noticed the two different colored lines - a connection between two applications and a connection involving a cloud service are marked differently in CloudShell.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <div class="title_text">Let's start the Sandbox</div>
      <p class="text_regular">Now it’s time to make the blueprint live and create your Staging sandbox by clicking the <strong>Reserve</strong> button. Launching the sandbox will deploy its components on new AWS instances located in a cloud subnet (in this case, an AWS VPC), which is dedicated to the sandbox and is completely isolated.<br><br>Please note that in your trial version you are limited to 2 hours per sandbox and up to 2 concurrent sandboxes.</p>

      <div class="blue title_text">What can I do in this Sandbox?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <div class="title_text">1 - Monitor</div>
      <p class="text_regular">When the sandbox starts, CloudShell launches the sandbox’s Setup process. This process automatically deploys all the component in the sandbox in the selected public cloud, in this case <strong>AWS US East (N. Virginia)</strong> region, and then configures them to the baseline state. You can <span class="text-span">monitor the Setup progress</span> by opening the Output console.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cintainer_image w-container"><img class="image-2" src="images/OUTPUT.png"></div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <p class="text_regular">Note that the Setup process might take some time. Please&nbsp;<span class="text-span-2">do not</span>&nbsp;end the sandbox before the Setup process completes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <div class="title_text">2 - Access</div>
      <p class="text_regular">Once the Setup has completed successfully, the sandbox will change its state to "Active". Now you can <span class="text-span-3">access the application</span>. Since it is a staging environment, My App's database and web servers don't have a public IP and are only accessible via AWS CloudFront or via the Elastic Load Balancer.<br>
        <br> To access My App's web interface, you can use the domain name link presented in the <strong>Output</strong> console after the Setup, or run the <strong>Get Access Information</strong> command on the "AWS CloudFront" service, which will return the domain name link in its output. It is also possible to access the "My App" application's web interface via the Elastic Load Balancer - just run the <strong>Get Access Information</strong> command on the "AWS Elastic Load Balancer" service and use the domain name link in the command's output.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cintainer_image w-container"><img class="image-2" src="images/OUTPUT_ELB.png" width="519"></div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <p class="text_regular">As this is a staging environment, the database and web servers themselves are accessible only in SSH via a proxy called QualiX, which has access to the sandbox's cloud subnet. To access them via SSH, hover over the appropriate App and click the <strong>SSH</strong> link.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cintainer_image w-container"><img class="image-2" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, 500px" src="images/Connect_SSH.png" srcset="images/Connect_SSH-p-500.png 500w, images/Connect_SSH.png 519w" width="519"></div>

      <div class="title_text">3 - Interact</div>
      <p class="text_regular">Each application comes with some default commands (that can be extended in the full version of CloudShell).<br>The commands can be found in the <strong>Commands</strong> side pane. To open the side pane, hover over the application and click the <strong>Commands</strong> button.</p><img sizes="(max-width: 564px) 92vw, 519px" src="images/ResourceCommands.png" srcset="images/ResourceCommands-p-500.png 500w, images/ResourceCommands.png 519w" width="519">
      <p class="text_regular">You may run any of the <strong>default commands</strong>.<br>
        <br> This sandbox also includes a custom sandbox command called <strong>Perform Healthcheck</strong>, which verifies that the web application is available both via the ELB and via the CDN (CloudFront), and updates their status accordingly. You can try it out, power off the MySQL DB VM and run the health-check command.<br>
        <br> Note that the public IP might change when you power the VM off and then on again. This will cause the access links to break and can be fixed by running the "Refresh IP" command.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_text w-container">
      <div class="title_text">4 - Teardown</div>
      <p class="text_regular">By default, the sandbox will automatically end once its allocated time has passed. However, you can manually <span class="text-span-4">stop the sandbox</span> when you finish working with it by clicking the <strong>End</strong> button.<br>When the sandbox ends, a Teardown process kicks in and deletes all the VMs along with the sandbox's dedicated VPC and Subnet in AWS. You can monitor the Teardown progress by opening the <strong>Output</strong> console.</p>
